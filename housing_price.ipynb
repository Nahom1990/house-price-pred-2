    "### 10) Save model & deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "* Save the **entire fitted pipeline** with `joblib.dump(pipeline, \"model.joblib\")`. The pipeline includes preprocessing so you can call `.predict()` on raw rows.\n",

    "### Q: *\"When will I apply all the transformations I made into my train data to test data?\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** Never fit preprocessors on test data. Fit (train) on training set only. Use the fitted pipeline to `.transform()` the test set. If you put all transformations in a `Pipeline` or `ColumnTransformer`, calling `pipeline.fit(X_train, y_train)` and later `pipeline.predict(X_test)` will apply exactly the same transformations to test — no leakage.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q: *\"Is cross validation placed at the right step?\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** CV is used during model evaluation and hyperparameter tuning. Use CV (inside `cross_val_score`) to compare baseline models. Use CV inside `GridSearchCV`/`RandomizedSearchCV` for tuning. If you're also selecting which model family to use, consider **nested CV** to avoid selection bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q: *\"Should I do grid search CV only for the model that got the best score or for all of them?\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** Do a **coarse search across several models**. Then do more expensive tuning on the top 1–3 candidates. That’s computationally efficient and effective in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q: *\"Should I do feature selection before feature engineering?\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** **Feature engineering first**, then **selection**. Rationale: you want selection to consider engineered features. But selection must be done inside the pipeline (fitted only on the training fold) to avoid leakage.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q: *\"Did I use PCA at the right step?\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** PCA (or TruncatedSVD) should be **after scaling and encoding** and **inside the pipeline**. Decide whether you use PCA as a feature reduction step (replace originals) or as a generator (FeatureUnion to keep both original + PCA components). PCA reduces interpretability — use it mainly for dimensionality reduction or to de-correlate features for linear models.\n",

Note that 'sag' and<br>  'saga' fast convergence is only guaranteed on features with<br>  approximately the same scale.

It is the most stable solver, in particular more stable<br>  for singular matrices than 'cholesky' at the cost of being slower.<br><br>- 'cholesky' uses the standard :func:`scipy.linalg.solve` function to<br>  obtain a closed-form solution.<br><br>- 'sparse_cg' uses the conjugate gradient solver as found in<br>  :func:`scipy.sparse.linalg.cg`. As an iterative algorithm, this solver is<br>  more appropriate than 'cholesky' for large-scale data<br>  (possibility to set `tol` and `max_iter`).<br><br>- 'lsqr' uses the dedicated regularized least-squares routine<br>  :func:`scipy.sparse.linalg.lsqr`. It is the fastest and uses an iterative<br>  procedure.<br><br>- 'sag' uses a Stochastic Average Gradient descent, and 'saga' uses<br>  its improved, unbiased version named SAGA. Both methods also use an<br>  iterative procedure, and are often faster than other solvers when<br>  both n_samples and n_features are large. Note that 'sag' and<br>  'saga' fast convergence is only guaranteed on features with<br>  approximately the same scale. You can preprocess the data with a<br>  scaler from :mod:`sklearn.preprocessing`.<br><br>- 'lbfgs' uses L-BFGS-B algorithm implemented in<br>  :func:`scipy.optimize.minimize`. It can be used only when `positive`<br>  is True.<br><br>All solvers except 'svd' support both dense and sparse data. However, only<br>'lsqr', 'sag', 'sparse_cg', and 'lbfgs' support sparse input when<br>`fit_intercept` is True.<br><br>.. versionadded:: 0.17<br>   Stochastic Average Gradient descent solver.<br>.. versionadded:: 0.19<br>   SAGA solver.</span>\n",

As an iterative algorithm, this solver is<br>  more appropriate than 'cholesky' for large-scale data<br>  (possibility to set `tol` and `max_iter`).<br><br>- 'lsqr' uses the dedicated regularized least-squares routine<br>  :func:`scipy.sparse.linalg.lsqr`. It is the fastest and uses an iterative<br>  procedure.<br><br>- 'sag' uses a Stochastic Average Gradient descent, and 'saga' uses<br>  its improved, unbiased version named SAGA. Both methods also use an<br>  iterative procedure, and are often faster than other solvers when<br>  both n_samples and n_features are large. Note that 'sag' and<br>  'saga' fast convergence is only guaranteed on features with<br>  approximately the same scale. You can preprocess the data with a<br>  scaler from :mod:`sklearn.preprocessing`.<br><br>- 'lbfgs' uses L-BFGS-B algorithm implemented in<br>  :func:`scipy.optimize.minimize`. It can be used only when `positive`<br>  is True.<br><br>All solvers except 'svd' support both dense and sparse data.

It is the most stable solver, in particular more stable<br>  for singular matrices than 'cholesky' at the cost of being slower.<br><br>- 'cholesky' uses the standard :func:`scipy.linalg.solve` function to<br>  obtain a closed-form solution.<br><br>- 'sparse_cg' uses the conjugate gradient solver as found in<br>  :func:`scipy.sparse.linalg.cg`. As an iterative algorithm, this solver is<br>  more appropriate than 'cholesky' for large-scale data<br>  (possibility to set `tol` and `max_iter`).<br><br>- 'lsqr' uses the dedicated regularized least-squares routine<br>  :func:`scipy.sparse.linalg.lsqr`. It is the fastest and uses an iterative<br>  procedure.<br><br>- 'sag' uses a Stochastic Average Gradient descent, and 'saga' uses<br>  its improved, unbiased version named SAGA. Both methods also use an<br>  iterative procedure, and are often faster than other solvers when<br>  both n_samples and n_features are large. Note that 'sag' and<br>  'saga' fast convergence is only guaranteed on features with<br>  approximately the same scale. You can preprocess the data with a<br>  scaler from :mod:`sklearn.preprocessing`.<br><br>- 'lbfgs' uses L-BFGS-B algorithm implemented in<br>  :func:`scipy.optimize.minimize`. It can be used only when `positive`<br>  is True.<br><br>All solvers except 'svd' support both dense and sparse data. However, only<br>'lsqr', 'sag', 'sparse_cg', and 'lbfgs' support sparse input when<br>`fit_intercept` is True.<br><br>.. versionadded:: 0.17<br>   Stochastic Average Gradient descent solver.<br>.. versionadded:: 0.19<br>   SAGA solver.</span>\n",
